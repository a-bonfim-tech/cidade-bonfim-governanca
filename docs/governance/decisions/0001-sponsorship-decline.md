# Decision Log 0001 — Decline of Sponsorship Prior to Baseline Maturity

## Context
During the initial stabilization phase of the *Cidade Bonfim Governança* repository, the possibility of testing or accepting sponsorship (“Sponsern ausprobieren”) was presented as an option.

At the time of this decision, the governance baseline was still under consolidation, with active definition of policies, controls, and audit mechanisms.

## Decision
The option **to test or accept sponsorship** was explicitly **declined**.

**Selected option:** Decline (“Nein, danke”).

## Rationale (Ethical and DevSecOps Compliance)
Accepting or experimenting with sponsorship at this stage would introduce ambiguity regarding:
- Decision independence
- Potential conflicts of interest
- Audit clarity and defensibility

In accordance with DevSecOps principles, governance maturity and ethical integrity must precede any form of external incentive or financial relationship.

## Principles Applied
- Independence of decision-making
- Least privilege (organizational and financial)
- Auditability and traceability
- Human accountability and responsibility
- Governance-before-scale

## Status
**Closed — Declined prior to baseline stabilization**

## Reconsideration Criteria
This decision may be revisited only if **all** the following conditions are met:
- Governance baseline reaches a stable tagged release (≥ v1.0.0)
- Internal governance checklist is fully satisfied
- At least one complete internal audit cycle is documented and published

## Notes
This decision is recorded as a governance control artifact and serves as evidence of ethical posture and DevSecOps alignment.
