# Ethical Inclusion of Content

> **Important note:** “Include the content in the repository. Without this being completed, it is not ethical to proceed (I will obviously review all content to decide, with responsibility and awareness, whether everything is in compliance).”

The inclusion of new artifacts in this repository must observe security, privacy, and audit principles that guide the DevSecOps culture. Below are the parameters and policies governing this operation.

## 📌 Operating Parameters

- **Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Delivery (CD):** all code and documentation added must pass through automated build, testing, and security validation pipelines.
- **Versioning and traceability:** use dedicated branches and clear commit messages; every change must be traceable back to its origin.
- **Access control:** apply the principle of least privilege; only authorized contributors may create or merge pull requests.

## 🧠 Conduct

- **Transparency:** document intentions, decisions, and reviews throughout the content inclusion process.
- **Shared responsibility:** all participants (developers, reviewers, auditors) are responsible for safeguarding security and compliance.
- **Mandatory human review:** artificial intelligence may assist in content production, but final approval always rests with a responsible human.

## 🔒 Privacy and Security

- **Protection of sensitive data:** do not store or expose credentials, private keys, or personal information.
- **Continuous scanning:** run static and dynamic analysis tools to identify vulnerabilities in code and documentation.
- **Encryption and secrecy:** references to production environments or real data must be tokenized or omitted.

## 🗂 Management and Audit

- **Activity logging:** maintain detailed logs of commits, builds, and deployments for subsequent audit.
- **Regulatory compliance:** align with regulations such as GDPR and the “Bonfim Security Constitution” for data protection requirements.
- **Quality metrics:** track security indicators (number of vulnerabilities, remediation time) and process indicators (review time, approval rate).

## 🛡 Defensible Action

- **Explicit justifications:** every content inclusion must have a documented and approved rationale.
- **Rollback plans:** prepare reversal strategies in case flaws or non-compliance are discovered after inclusion.
- **Periodic audits:** regularly review the repository to ensure past additions remain aligned with DevSecOps standards.

---

By following these guidelines, we ensure that the incorporation of any new content is **secure, reliable, auditable, and defensible**, respecting ethical principles and DevSecOps best practices.
