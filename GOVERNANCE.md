All security-related activities documented in this repository are limited to detection, analysis, and governance. Observation does not constitute enforcement, and awareness does not imply authority to act.

Any form of intervention, preventive action, or investigation requires explicit legal mandate and institutional responsibility. This repository does not replace, replicate, or simulate the functions of law-enforcement, judicial, or regulatory bodies.
